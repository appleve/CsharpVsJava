Java:
package hello;
import xxx;
public class HelloWorld {
   public static void main(String[] args) {
      System.out.println("Hello World");
    }
}	


C#:
using System;

namespace Hello {
   public class HelloWorld {
      public static void Main(string[] args) {
         Console.WriteLine("Hello World");
      }
   }
}


* package == namespace : you can understand it as folder structure where to list you class files

* import == using : use/import the existing code package, please notice that before to use it in your project you have to add the package to the project reference

* main == Main: the main Method name, the first case of the name follow the different name rule or user habit (eg. java:theMethodName, C#:TheMethodName), 
in one program only support one main method, the mthod name is case sensitive, 
that means Main main will be recognised as different name, they can exist at the same time, you can <b>TRY IT</b> by yourself, and then you will unsterstand this
more expressive.
