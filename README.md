# CsharpVsJava
a lot of people say the Java is the same with C# or C# is the same with Java, so i want compare them in detail from syntax 


Preparation:
IDE: for jAVA we use Eclipse, you can get it form the website https://www.eclipse.org/. for C# we usually use Microsoft Visual Studio, you can download it from the Microsoft website and offcourse it need license, or FOR FREE you can use the Community version or VScode(Visual Studio Code), all of them are produced by Microsoft you can download them via https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/.
